# Facial-Recgonition-using-pytorch
*Implementation of Face-Detection using Detectron2 with Faster-RCNN and data cleaning of the Face-Detection Dataset taken from kaggle.
*Data Processing of the Kaggle Dataset containing only the URLs and annotations of the Face Images.
*The Kaggle Dataset consisted of only URLs of the image but with the help of data processing i managed to process the images.
*Later the model was trained on Faster-Rcnn which is the best model for face detection.
*Implementation of Face-Detection using Detectron2 with Faster-RCNN  and data cleaning of the Face-Detection Dataset.Data Processing of the Kaggle Dataset containing only the URLs and annotations of the Face Images.
*Improved the accuracy of a Computer Vision model by 1.8 percent using the Swish Activation Function.






MY RESULTS: 
I have applied the model on my face.
