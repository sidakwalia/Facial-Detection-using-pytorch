# Facial-Recgonition-using-pytorch
Facial Recognition using pytorch



Implementation of Face-Detection using Detectron2 with Faster-RCNN and data cleaning of the Face-Detection Dataset taken from kaggle.
Data Processing of the Kaggle Dataset containing only the URLs and annotations of the Face Images.
The Kaggle Dataset consisted of only URLs of the image but with the helpo of data processing i managed to process the images.
Later the model was trained on Faster-Rcnn which is the best model for face detection.
